# Understanding the sync Package

The Go `sync` package provides essential building blocks for safely handling shared resources across multiple goroutines. Key primitives include:

- **Mutex**: Ensures mutual exclusion, allowing only one goroutine to access a critical section at a time.
- **RWMutex**: Optimized for read-heavy scenarios, permitting multiple readers or one writer.
- **WaitGroup**: Waits for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
- **Once**: Guarantees that a piece of code runs only once, even if called from multiple goroutines.
- **Cond**: Enables complex signaling between goroutines using condition variables.
- **Pool**: Manages a set of temporary objects for efficient reuse, reducing garbage collection overhead.

These tools help prevent race conditions and coordinate concurrent operations in Go programs.
